# Project

In this project we’re going to build an app that lets the user import photos from their library, then modify them using various image effects. We’ll cover a number of new techniques, but at the center of it all are one useful app development skill – using Apple’s Core Image framework – and one important SwiftUI skill – integrating with UIKit. There are other things too, but those two are the big takeaways.

# Challenge

1. Try making the Save button disabled if there is no image in the image view.

2. Experiment with having more than one slider, to control each of the input keys you care about. For example, you might have one for radius and one for intensity.

3. Explore the range of available Core Image filters, and add any three of your choosing to the app.
