# Challenges

1. Our address fields are currently considered valid if they contain anything, even if it’s just only whitespace. Improve the validation to make sure a string of pure whitespace is invalid.
2. If our call to placeOrder() fails – for example if there is no internet connection – show an informative alert for the user. To test this, try commenting out the request.httpMethod = "POST" line in your code, which should force the request to fail.
3. For a more challenging task, see if you can convert our data model from a class to a struct, then create an ObservableObject class wrapper around it that gets passed around. This will result in your class having one @Published property, which is the data struct inside it, and should make supporting Codable on the struct much easier.
