# Project Flashzilla

In this project we’re going to build Hot Prospects, which is an app to track who you meet at conferences. You’ve probably seen apps like it before: it will show a QR code that stores your attendee information, then others can scan that code to add you to their list of possible leads for later follow up.



# Challenges

1. Add an icon to the “Everyone” screen showing whether a prospect was contacted or not.

2. Use JSON and the documents directory for saving and loading our user data.

3. Use a confirmation dialog to customize the way users are sorted in each tab – by name or by most recent.
