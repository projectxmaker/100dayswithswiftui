# Challenges

1. Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
2. Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
3. Give the tip percentage picker a wider range of options – everything from 0% to 100%.
