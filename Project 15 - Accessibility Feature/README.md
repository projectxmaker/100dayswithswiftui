# Project

Making your app accessible means taking steps to ensure that everyone can use it fully regardless of their individual needs. For example, if they are blind then your app should work well with the system’s VoiceOver system to ensure your UI can be read smoothly.

# Challenge

1. The check out view in Cupcake Corner uses an image and loading spinner that don’t add anything to the UI, so find a way to make the screenreader not read them out.

2. Fix the list rows in iExpense so they read out the name and value in one single VoiceOver label, and their type in a hint.

3. Do a full accessibility review of Moonshot – what changes do you need to make so that it’s fully accessible?
